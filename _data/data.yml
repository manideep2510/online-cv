    title: ABOUT ME
    summary: |
      Hello, I am Manideep Kolla, a pre-final year undergraduate student from Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati with major in Electronics and Communication Engineering but my major interest has been in the field of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence during my Undergraduate studies. I have been a part of Dr. Prithwijit Guha's research group and have also worked in two startups named [UncannyVision](http://www.uncannyvision.com/) and [Chainrule.ai](Chainrule.ai) till date during my sophomore year in various applications of Deep Learning, particularly computer vision in Security surveillance and Medicine. I see AI as the current technological revolution and I want to mark my impact on this revolution. I am also the Convenor of Entrepreneurial Development Cell, IIT Guwahati in which I have been a key member since past two years. With an entrepreneurial mind, I always seek solutions for problems I observe. I just want everyone to have a fair life and I am going to do my best to bring the equality which our world lacks.
      
      I use my free time to grow my network through Linkedin or speaking to people personally and I am not a very frequent book reader, but I have read and love to read quite a few non-fiction books like Sapiens, Factfulness, Origin Story, Wings of Fire. Occasionally I also write stories. 
      
      Apart from these, I am a movie buff and particularly I love suspense mystery movies because I love to try and guess the villain of the story. I am a crazy cricket fan and I have played professional cricket for Cricket Club, IIT Guwahati. I also enjoy cooking and I cook every time I go home. I will always be up to date on the topics I care about.
