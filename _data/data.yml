    title: ABOUT ME
    summary: |
      Hello, I am Manideep Kolla, a pre-final year undergraduate student from Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati with major in Electronics and Communication Engineering but my major interest has been in the field of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence during my Undergraduate studies. I have been a part of Dr. Prithwijit Guha's research group and have also worked in two startups named [UncannyVision](http://www.uncannyvision.com/) and [Chainrule.ai](Chainrule.ai) till date during my sophomore year in various applications of Deep Learning, particularly computer vision in Security surveillance and Medicine. I see AI as the current technological revolution and I want to mark my impact on this revolution. I am also the Convenor of Entrepreneurial Development Cell, IIT Guwahati in which I have been a key member since past two years. With an entrepreneurial mind, I always seek solutions for problems I observe. I just want everyone to have a fair life and I am going to do my best to bring the equality which our world lacks.
      
      I use my free time to grow my network through Linkedin or speaking to people personally and I am not a very frequent book reader, but I have read and love to read quite a few non-fiction books like Sapiens, Factfulness, Origin Story, Wings of Fire. Occasionally I also write stories. 
      
      Apart from these, I am a movie buff and particularly I love suspense mystery movies because I love to try and guess the villain of the story. I am a crazy cricket fan and I have played professional cricket for Cricket Club, IIT Guwahati. I also enjoy cooking and I cook every time I go home. I will always be up to date on the topics I care about.

experiences:
    - role: Deep Learning Intern
      time: May 2018 - July 2018
      company: Uncanny Vision, Bangalore
      details: |
        Uncanny Vision is a startup based in Bangalore funded by companies like Renesas, Qualcomm. Major work done here is on smart surveillance i.e, the application of Deep Learning to Security Surveillance systems and has many patents in the area. Uncanny Vision has contracts with Japan Government, Renesas, Bosch, with Bangalore metro and many other companies. As a summer intern,

          - Kickstarted the research on Person Re-Identification at the company for smart security surveillance. 
          - In particular, I worked on the problem of Person or Object Re-Identification using pose estimation. In just 2 months, I have built a Person Re-Id algorithm which is ready to incorporate on the security camera module.
          - Built a deep network with a Siamese like architecture which uses pose estimation along with a special similarity estimation layer which shot the accuracy near to the state of the art at 85% on a very challenging real-life data from a partner company.

    - role: Deep Learning Intern
      time: March 2018 - May 2018
      company: Chainrule.ai, San Francisco Bay area
      details: |
        Chainrule.ai is an early stage startup based in Silicon Valley, San Francisco Bay Area. The main goal of the company is to create a user end applications suit for doctors to help them detect various types of cancers in different parts of the human body effectively in less amount of time. Work is being done on detection of different types of cancers like skin cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, intestine cancers, etc. As an intern,

          - Worked on building deep learning algorithms for segmentation and classification of different types of skin cancers.
          - After experimenting with different types of convolution-deconvolution networks like U-net. I have achieved Jaccard index of about 0.7 using a U-net like model in segmentation. 
          - I have used an ensemble of multiple ResNets and have achieved an accuracy of about 92% in classification.
